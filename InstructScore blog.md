## Introduction
Text generation is a vital aspect of natural language processing (NLP), involving tasks like story generation, summarization, and dialogue systems. Evaluating these models has always been challenging, as traditional methods often lack interpretations of their predictions or fail to connect the scores to specific flaws in the generated text. INSTRUCTSCORE, a novel approach to evaluating text generation models, aims to bridge this gap by providing explainable feedback without relying on human-annotated data. This blog post delves into the mechanics of INSTRUCTSCORE and its implications for the NLP community.

## INSTRUCTSCORE Overview
INSTRUCTSCORE stands out by providing explainable, detailed feedback on the performance of text generation models. Unlike conventional evaluation metrics that offer a single score, INSTRUCTSCORE provides both a numerical score and a human readable diagnostic report, including error location, error type, severity level, and score justification. This allows developers and researchers to understand not just how well their model is performing, but also in which specific areas it excels or needs improvement.

The core idea behind INSTRUCTSCORE is to align the evaluation process more closely with human judgment. Traditional metrics like BLEU or ROUGE rely heavily on reference texts and can often miss the subtleties of human-like text generation. INSTRUCTSCORE, on the other hand, employs a more holistic approach, considering factors that are more aligned with human perceptions of quality and fluency in text.
## Problem Definition
The objective of INSTRUCTSCORE is to develop an explainable metric model that not only predicts the quality score of candidate text in relation to a reference but also generates a diagnostic report in natural language. INSTRUCTSCORE evaluates the quality of a generated text (x) with respect to a reference (r) by producing a detailed diagnostic report. This report includes specifics about error location (l), error type (t), severity level (se), and explanation (e) associated with each identified error. INSTRUCTSCORE comprises two main components: a score predictor and an explanation generator (Exp-Generator). The Exp-Generator is tasked with learning a function f: (x, r) → {(l, t, se, e)i}^n_i=1, which identifies n number of errors in the text. However, acquiring human-annotated mapping data for most text generation tasks is challenging due to limited resources and high annotation costs. INSTRUCTSCORE addresses this by proposing a data construction method to automatically generate high-quality pseudo data for learning the function f.
## Methodology
INSTRUCTScore is composed of a score predictor and an explanation generator (Exp-Generator) which learns a function f: (x, y) → {(l, t, se, e)i}^n_{i=1}

### Synthetic Data Construction
In this step, GPT-4 is leveraged to extract representative explainable knowledge that can greatly contribute to the subsequent Exp-Generator learning process.

## Applications and Implications
INSTRUCTSCORE can be particularly beneficial in refining text generation models. By pinpointing specific areas of strength and weakness, developers can tailor their approach to model improvement. This can lead to more efficient and targeted model development, ultimately resulting in more human-like and effective text generation systems.

Furthermore, INSTRUCTSCORE's approach to evaluation can significantly contribute to the broader understanding of what constitutes "good" generated text. This understanding is crucial as we continue to integrate AI into more aspects of our digital lives, especially in areas like chatbots, virtual assistants, and automated content creation.

## Limitations
While INSTRUCTSCORE represents a significant advancement in text generation evaluation, it is not without limitations. The complexity of the evaluation process means that it may require more resources and time compared to traditional methods. Additionally, the reliance on human judgment for certain aspects of the evaluation could introduce subjectivity into the process.

## Conclusion
INSTRUCTSCORE is a promising development in the field of NLP, offering a more nuanced and detailed way to evaluate text generation models. Its focus on explainability and fine-grained feedback not only aids in model development but also contributes to our understanding of natural language processing. As the field of AI continues to evolve, approaches like INSTRUCTSCORE will be crucial in bridging the gap between human and machine-generated text.
